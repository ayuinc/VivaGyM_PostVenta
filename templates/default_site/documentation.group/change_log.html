<p><a name="v1.8.0"></a></p>

<li>Removed support for ExpressionEngine 1.x (Calendar is now EE2 only).</li>
<li>Added offline documentation files to download package.</li>
<li>Added two new hooks for manipulating pagination data:
'calendar_build_calendar_create_pagination' and
'calendar_events_create_pagination'.</li>
<li>Added {event_count} and {event_total} variables to {events} variable
pair for use in Calendar:Cal tag.</li>
<li>Added extra instructions to the Calendar channel field 'ICS URL' to
notate that all imported times are adjusted to that calendar's offset.</li>
<li>Updated the 'date_range_end' parameter to have a default value of end
of the day instead of the current date and time as the
'date_range_start' parameter.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Calendar was incorrectly putting defaults on text
type columns that aren't compatible with MySQL strict mode.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Calendar inserts on install were not MySQL Strict
mode compliant.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where imported entry titles would get auto-truncated in
non-MySQL Strict mode silently, and error in MySQL Strict mode. Titles
are all now restricted to 100 characters in length before sending to
the database, as that is the column limit for channel entry titles.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where some Calendar ICS imports running BYDAY rules could
cause errors during the import stage of a new calendar.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where imported events with no title were not receiving a
default title value of "No Title".</li>

defaulting to the Default Timezone in Calendar Preferences.</li>

parameter was not present and would throw PHP errors.</li>

searches for the lowest status group ID as the default and uses '0' if
none are present. This affects new installs only.</li>

hooking into the Channel module and result in missing event errors.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where errors would occur when using the Calendar:Cal tag
with PHP 5.4.x.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where creating new event rules could cause errors to occur
when using MySQL in strict mode.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where setting the Calendar events 'Dates &amp; Options' field
to be required, and editing an event occurrence would result in the
inability to submit the entry.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where using '%I' in a date format could result in a PHP
error being shown.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where using '%F' in a date format could result in an
invalid language line loaded.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where iCalendar format export for Calendars with a
timezone of GMT-0 would incorrectly set TZOFFSETTO to '0000' instead
of '+0000' and cause imports into certain calendar software (including
Google Calendar) to error and fail the import.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where an infinite update loop could occur if Calendar
extensions were disabled but the module version number was up to date.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where recurring events would not take into account
'date_range_start' and 'date_range_end' hours and minutes.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where giving non-integer values to the 'event_id' or
'calendar_id' parameters could result in a MySQL error instead of
gracefully falling back to default.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the 'event_offset' parameter in the Calendar:Events
tag wouldn't function without the 'event_limit' parameter being set.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where new rules added in the Calendar widget of the
publish page would not use alternate languages set by the system.</li>
<li>Fixed some bugs that could occur when upgrading ExpressionEngine 1.x
to 2.x with Calendar installed.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where adding exceptions or occurrences could result in a
MySQL error when MySQL was running in Strict mode.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where 'Reply To' and 'Reply Name' were not being parsed
for variables or sent through to hooks.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where, given no start and end date ranges, the default
date range would not end at the end of the last day.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where 'pad_short_weeks' would lose the end time of
time_range_end and would set it inadvertently to the beginning of the
last day.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the rule removal button in the publish area would
not function in some situations when editing events.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the text time parser would mistakenly consider
12:00 pm as 00:00 military time rather than 12:00 and conversly would
consider 12:00 am as 12:00 military time rather than 00:00.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where foreign language translation files would not load
for Calendar unless the system default was set to the language desired
and not just the current logged in users language preference.</li>
<li>Fixed some rendering bugs with the Calendar widget that could cause
javascript errors when foreign languages were used.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where pagination would not properly load foreign language
lines for first and last link names.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where EE 1.x would not properly alert users if an update
failed because of extensions being disabled.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where some date formats were too aggressively cached and
would result in incorrect output.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Calendar was not compatible with EE 2.5.x's ability
to move the third party themes folder.</li>

<h2>Version 1.5.4 (March 10, 2011)</h2>

<li>Modified the behavior of the show_years=, show_months=,

{month format=""}, {week format=""}, {day format=""} variable pairs.</li>

only work in the current year.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where recurring dates on a second rule when an event was
edited would not show up correctly.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the event_last_date variable on repeat events
was not being parsed correctly.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where a rule with a single day would be skipped over
during event display parsing if the second rule was more complex.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with the Calendar:Mini tag where time_range_end was
not set and caused all events to always be skipped.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where creating an event with an end date past 2012-12-31
would result in an 'end of world' error when the calendar was set to
'Mayan'.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with {exception_ style tags in the Events loop which
was causing them to never parse.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where exception parsing was incorrectly caching the
formatted date.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where exclusions (EXDATE) were never getting inserted
into items exported as iCalendar files.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where previous_occurrences_limit="" parameter was not
being respected when showing events that never ended.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where occurrences where not getting all event data or
conditionals.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the Channel Entries API was not always being
loaded in EE 2.x.</li>
<li>Removed the unused CALENDAR_ACTIONS constant as it was unused.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="v1.5.3"></a></p>

<h2>Version 1.5.3 (January 12, 2011)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added an {if event_never_ends} conditional to the Calendar:Events
tag to check to see if an event repeats endlessly.</li>

of native EE 1.x styling.</li>

non-Calendar channels.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where filtering, sorting, and pagination did not work on
the Events and Occurrences Edit page in Calendar CP.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the Calendar Publish UI would not properly respect
the "Datepicker Date Format" preference when adding rules.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where deleting a Calendar channel entry would not remove
all Event entries assigned to it.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where ICS importing would not work correctly in EE 2.x.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the SAEF date pickers would appear behind some
fields/divs in EE 1.x.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the hour, day, week, month, and year
"_event_count" and "_event_total" variables and conditionals did
not always parse correctly.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the "First Day of the Week" preference was not
being respected on date pickers.</li>

with custom edited occurrences that lets the user delete them all
automatically if they make DATE changes to an event (rather than
have those occurrences be orphaned).</li>

Calendar:Cal tag.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused modified occurrences to be wiped out if the
parent entry was edited.</li>

incorrect URL path.</li>

in date variables.</li>

files were being trimmed to "n", rather than being treated as actual
newlines.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where carriage returns (&#92;r) in incoming ICS files were
resulting in newlines in incoming data where there shouldn't have
been newlines.</li>

affect other rules' "End" settings as well.</li>

variable was often incorrect.</li>
